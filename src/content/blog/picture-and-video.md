OK now we gonna do it's with the **Video**. For **Video** that we have some way to use it like down below:

```html
<video controls>
  <source src="your-video-url" type="video/mp4" />
  Your browser does not support the video tag.
</video>
```

And here we go!!!

<video controls>
  <source src="http://media.w3.org/2010/05/sintel/trailer.mp4" type="video/mp4" />
  Your browser does not support the video tag.
</video>

We finally made it both videos and pictures implement to your post.

# Summary
